                <li>While you are cooking your chicken, the water should be done boiling, place your uncooked pasta into the boiling water and let it cook for 12-14 minutes (check at 12 minute mark and take out when texture is desired) </li>
                <li>Boil your broccoli in another pot of water while pasta is cooking</li>
